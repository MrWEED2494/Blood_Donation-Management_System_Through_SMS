                Consider the individuals in the hospital
                needing a blood transfusion. A gunshot or accident victim. Any person needing
                an ample supply of blood while in surgery. These people need us, and what they
                ask for is very little. Just imagine what a few pints of blood can do and how
                many lives it can save.

                Donating blood has many health benefits.
                Not only will you help someone in need of blood, but you will also help
                optimize your health and wellness. Here are the top three health benefits from
                donating blood.

                According to a new study published by
                the American Medical Association, giving blood every six months led to fewer
                heart attacks and strokes in test participants ages 43 to 61.

                Excessive iron is thought to contribute
                to heart disease, especially at its early stages. Donating blood on a regular
                basis reduces the iron stores in the body and this study supports the theory
                that reducing iron appears to preserve cardiovascular health.

                A second study of 2,682 men in Finland,
                reported in the <i>American Journal of Epidemiology</i>, found that men who
                donated blood at least once a year had an 88 percent lower risk of heart
                attacks than non-donors.

                Give blood to help lower your risk of
                cancer. According to the Miller-Keystone Blood Center, consistent blood
                donation is associated with lowered risks for cancers including liver, lung,
                colon, stomach and throat cancers.2

                Risk levels dropped in correlation with
                how often participants donated blood. The association between lower cancer risk
                and donating blood might also stem from reducing oxidative stress. Free radical
                compounds can damage your DNA. Damaged genetic material is the hallmark of all
                cancers.
